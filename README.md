# My senior year assignment: Electromechanical pinball to electronic pinball

It uses a http://www.pridopia.co.uk/pi-23s17-4-v2.html wich has 4 MCP23S17 SPI GPIO Expander IC's on a compact board wich fits the Pi

# Boardcontroller.py

This is the main program wich will control the board and send data to the screen

# Test.py

This is the original code that came from pridopia.co.uk
